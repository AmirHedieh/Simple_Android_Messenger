# Simple_Android_Messenger
an android messenger based on google firebase that at this very moment has these features:
1- Registering and signing in (Authentication)
2- chatting with other signed up users(Sending and receiving messages)

Note:
-to install app make sure that you have the latest version of Google_Play_Services.
-google blocks some countries IP from accessing Firebase. so if you have problem in registering and signing in to app, you may need to changed your IP.

this project is on progress right now and further features will be added. any help to improve the app will be appreciated.
